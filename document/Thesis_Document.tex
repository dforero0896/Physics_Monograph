	\chapter{Radioactivity}
	Radioactivity is the phenomenon in which a parent isotope turn into a daughter isotope, with different characteristics, through the emmission of a particle.\\
	The history of radioactivity goes back to 1896, when H. Becquerel discovered that a uranium sample emmited some kind of penetrating radiation similar to the X rays (discovered earlier that year). In the following years, three different types of emissions were identified: alpha ($\alpha$), beta ($\beta$) and gamma ($ \gamma$). The nature of each of these emissions was identified through the years, concluding that $\alpha$-particles correspond to $^4He$ nuclei, $\beta^\pm$-particles correspond to $e^\pm$ (electrons or positrons) and $\gamma$-particles are nothing but high energy photons.\\
	Rutherford discovered that radioactive phenomena was linked directly with the nucleus ($\sim 1 fm$) of a given isotope, thus, it is an entirely quantum phenomenon.\\
	The overall radioactive phenomena are described by a rather simple mathematical approach given the statistical behavior of the phenomena (which is a result, and evidence of how ``quantum''it is). Given $N$ parent isotopes in a sample at a given time $t$ and assuming no more are added, the rate of decay ($dN/dt$) is proportional to $N$ \cite{Krane1988} 
	\begin{equation}
	\frac{dN}{dt}=-\lambda N
	\end{equation}
	That, upon integration becomes 
	\begin{equation}
	N(t)=N_0\exp(-\lambda t)
	\end{equation}
	Where $N_0$ corresponds to the number of parent isotopes at time $t=0$ and $\lambda$ is called the decay constant and is unique for every isotope.\\
	This simple model has been key to the use of the radioactive isotopes to, for example, date rocks or organisms.\\
	Let us now go deeper into the theory of the radioactivity.
	
	\section{Alpha decay}
	The theory of the alpha decay is rather simple. $\alpha$-particles are confined in a finite potential well (the nucleus $X$ ) and will, as expected, have a certain probability of tunneling said barrier. When this happens, the $\alpha$-particle will escape and leave a ``new'' (daughter) nucleus $X'$ \cite{Krane1988}. The process may be written as
	\begin{equation}
^A_ZX_N\rightarrow^{A-4}_{Z-2}X'_{N-2} + \alpha
	\end{equation}
	Where $A$ is the atomic mass number, $Z$ is the atomic number and $N$ is the charge.\\
	This decay involves both strong (nuclear) interactions and electromagnetic interactions since the potential well is given by confinement due to strong interaction between nucleons and the barrier has a decaying-exponential side, given by the Coulomb potential.
	\section{Gamma decay}
	Gamma decay is similar to the common electromagnetic emission due to atomic transitions, in fact, it is produced when a metastable state of an isotope decays into a more stable state through the emission of high energy photons. It should be noted that, in this case, no change in $A$ or $N$ is produced. These metastable states are common daughter isotopes to $\alpha$ and $\beta$ decays.\\
	Lifetimes for this kind of process is generally short, taking only fractions of a second to decay while some $\alpha$-decaying isotopes may have half-lives of the order of $10^3yr$.
	\section{Beta decay}
	This type of decay can be considered to be more complex than the other two, as it responds to more complicated undelying physics: the weak interaction.\\
	There are three kinds of $\beta$ decay, which are \\
