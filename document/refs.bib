abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the evolution operator and the transition probabilities expressed as functions of the vacuum mass squared differences, the vacuum mixing angles, and the matter density parameter for three flavor neutrino oscillations in matter of varying density in the plane wave approximation. The applications of this to neutrino oscillations in a model of the Earth's matter density profile, step function matter density profiles, constant matter density profiles, linear matter density profiles, and finally in a model of the Sun's matter density profile are discussed. We show that for matter density profiles, which do not fluctuate too much, the total evolution operator consisting of {\$}n{\$} operators can be replaced by one single evolution operator in the semi-classical approximation.},

abstract = {The detection of electron antineutrinos produced by natural radioactivity in the Earth could yield important geophysical information. The Kamioka liquid scintillator antineutrino detector (KamLAND) has the sensitivity to detect electron antineutrinos produced by the decay of 238U and 232Th within the Earth. Earth composition models suggest that the radiogenic power from these isotope decays is 16 TW, approximately half of the total measured heat dissipation rate from the Earth. Here we present results from a search for geoneutrinos with KamLAND. Assuming a Th/U mass concentration ratio of 3.9, the 90 per cent confidence interval for the total number of geoneutrinos detected is 4.5 to 54.2. This result is consistent with the central value of 19 predicted by geophysical models. Although our present data have limited statistical power, they nevertheless provide by direct means an upper limit (60 TW) for the radiogenic power of U and Th in the Earth, a quantity that is currently poorly constrained.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the amount and distribution of radiogenic heating in the mantle is crucial for understanding the dynamics of the Earth, including its thermal evolution, the style and planform of mantle convection, and the energetics of the core. Although the flux of heat from the surface of the planet is robustly estimated, the contributions of radiogenic heating and secular cooling remain poorly defined. Constraining the amount of heat-producing elements in the Earth will provide clues to understanding nebula condensation and planetary formation processes in early Solar System. Mantle radioactivity supplies power for mantle convection and plate tectonics, but estimates of mantle radiogenic heat production vary by a factor of more than 20. Recent experimental results demonstrate the potential for direct assessment of mantle radioactivity through observations of geoneutrinos, which are emitted by naturally occurring radionuclides. Predictions of the geoneutrino signal from the mantle exist for several established estimates of mantle composition. Here we present novel analyses, illustrating surface variations of the mantle geoneutrino signal for models of the deep mantle structure, including those based on seismic tomography. These variations have measurable differences for some models, allowing new and meaningful constraints on the dynamics of the planet. An ocean based geoneutrino detector deployed at several strategic locations will be able to discriminate between competing compositional models of the bulk silicate Earth. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

It discusses all the topics vital to the understanding of the nature of neutrinos such as what they are, how to describe them, how they behave in nature, and the roles of neutrinos play in shaping our Universe. The book provides comprehensive discussions, both experimental and theoretical, with relevant mathematical details, on neutrino oscillations, extra-terrestrial as well as terrestrial neutrinos and relic neutrinos. It also discusses many implications of current experimental data on rector, accelerator, atmospheric, solar and supernova neutrinos with future perspectives. The book starts with an introduction to field theory and gauge theory which is accessible even to advanced undergraduate students, with helpful appendices, and it also provides pedagogical but sufficiently detailed reviews of supernova physics and cosmology, in particular the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. It aims to provide all the technical details necessary for the professionals in the field and to be an almost exhaustive reference for neutrino physicists with 1000 references.},

The data set was supplemented with a special study of 12 years of ISC phase data which yielded an additional 1.75 ?? 106 travel time observations for P and S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by 2-4{\%}, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper mantle. High Sn velocities, low Pn velocities and a pronounced low-velocity zone are features of most global inversion models that are suppressed when anisotropy is allowed for in the inversion. The Preliminary Reference Earth Model, PREM, and auxiliary tables showing fits to the data are presented. ?? 1981.},

abstract = {[1] The recent geoneutrino experimental results from KamLAND (Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Anti-neutrino Detector) and Borexino detectors reveal the usefulness of analyzing the Earth's geoneutrino flux, as it provides a constraint on the strength of the radiogenic heat power, and this, in turn, provides a test of compositional models of the bulk silicate Earth (BSE). This flux is dependent on the amount and distribution of heat-producing elements (HPEs: U, Th, and K) in the Earth's interior. We have developed a geophysically based, three-dimensional global reference model for the abundances and distribu-tions of HPEs in the BSE. The structure and composition of the outermost portion of the Earth, the crust and underlying lithospheric mantle, are detailed in the reference model; this portion of the Earth has the greatest influence on the geoneutrino fluxes. The reference model combines three existing geophysical models of the global crust and yields an average crustal thickness of 34.4 AE 4.1 km in the continents and 8.0 AE 2.7 km in the oceans, and a total mass (in 10 22 kg) of oceanic, continental, and bulk crust is 0.67 AE 0.23, 2.06 AE 0.25, and 2.73 AE 0.48, respectively. In situ seismic velocity provided by CRUST 2.0 allows us to estimate the average composition of the deep continental crust by using new and updated compositional databases for amphibolite and granulite facies rocks in combination with laboratory ultrasonic velocities measurements. An updated xenolithic peridotite database is used to represent the average composition of continental lithospheric mantle.

abstract = {We propose a new model of Earth's bulk composition based on enstatite chondrites (E-chondrites), the only chondrite group isotopically identical to the Earth. This model allows a quantitative study of accretion and differentiation processes in the early Earth. Conditions for core formation are evaluated using data on silica-iron equilibrium at high pressure and temperature and the exchange budget equation SiO2+2Fe=Si+2FeO, which is the result of IW and Si-SiO2 oxygen buffers' interaction and controls the evolution of mantle fO2. Based on that equation, ranges for the compositions of the Bulk Silicate Earth, the lower mantle and the core are deduced from the compositions of E-chondrites and their constituents. For these ranges of compositions, we show that during core differentiation, the mantle fO2 evolves naturally from ≈IW-3.2 to IW-1.4±0.1. The model compositions are tightened using geophysical constraints on (1) the amount of light elements in the core, (2) the petrology of the upper and lower mantle and (3) the thermal and convective structure of the lower mantle. Our results indicate that the lower mantle is enriched in Si and Fe, which is consistent with recent geophysical studies, and depleted in highly refractory elements, notably in Uranium and Thorium. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},
