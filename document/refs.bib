abstract = {This book deals with neutrino physics and astrophysics- a field in which some of the most exciting recent developments in particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology took place. The book is the most up-to-date, comprehensive and self-contained treatment of key issues in neutrino physics. It discusses all the topics vital to the understanding of the nature of neutrinos such as what they are, how to describe them, how they behave in nature, and the roles of neutrinos play in shaping our Universe. The book provides comprehensive discussions, both experimental and theoretical, with relevant mathematical details, on neutrino oscillations, extra-terrestrial as well as terrestrial neutrinos and relic neutrinos. It also discusses many implications of current experimental data on rector, accelerator, atmospheric, solar and supernova neutrinos with future perspectives. The book starts with an introduction to field theory and gauge theory which is accessible even to advanced undergraduate students, with helpful appendices, and it also provides pedagogical but sufficiently detailed reviews of supernova physics and cosmology, in particular the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. It aims to provide all the technical details necessary for the professionals in the field and to be an almost exhaustive reference for neutrino physicists with 1000 references.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the evolution operator and the transition probabilities expressed as functions of the vacuum mass squared differences, the vacuum mixing angles, and the matter density parameter for three flavor neutrino oscillations in matter of varying density in the plane wave approximation. The applications of this to neutrino oscillations in a model of the Earth's matter density profile, step function matter density profiles, constant matter density profiles, linear matter density profiles, and finally in a model of the Sun's matter density profile are discussed. We show that for matter density profiles, which do not fluctuate too much, the total evolution operator consisting of {\$}n{\$} operators can be replaced by one single evolution operator in the semi-classical approximation.},

abstract = {The detection of electron antineutrinos produced by natural radioactivity in the Earth could yield important geophysical information. The Kamioka liquid scintillator antineutrino detector (KamLAND) has the sensitivity to detect electron antineutrinos produced by the decay of 238U and 232Th within the Earth. Earth composition models suggest that the radiogenic power from these isotope decays is 16 TW, approximately half of the total measured heat dissipation rate from the Earth. Here we present results from a search for geoneutrinos with KamLAND. Assuming a Th/U mass concentration ratio of 3.9, the 90 per cent confidence interval for the total number of geoneutrinos detected is 4.5 to 54.2. This result is consistent with the central value of 19 predicted by geophysical models. Although our present data have limited statistical power, they nevertheless provide by direct means an upper limit (60 TW) for the radiogenic power of U and Th in the Earth, a quantity that is currently poorly constrained.},

The new techniques in neutrino detection opened a door into a completely new inter-disciplinary field of Neutrino Geoscience. We give here a broad geological introduction highlighting the points where the geo-neutrino measurements can give substantial new insights. The status-of-art of this field is overviewed, including a description of the latest experimental results from KamLAND and Borexino experiments and their first geological implications. We performed a new combined Borexino and KamLAND analysis in terms of the extraction of the mantle geo-neutrino signal and the limits on the Earth's radiogenic heat power. The perspectives and the future projects having geo-neutrinos among their scientific goals are also discussed.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the amount and distribution of radiogenic heating in the mantle is crucial for understanding the dynamics of the Earth, including its thermal evolution, the style and planform of mantle convection, and the energetics of the core. Although the flux of heat from the surface of the planet is robustly estimated, the contributions of radiogenic heating and secular cooling remain poorly defined. Constraining the amount of heat-producing elements in the Earth will provide clues to understanding nebula condensation and planetary formation processes in early Solar System. Mantle radioactivity supplies power for mantle convection and plate tectonics, but estimates of mantle radiogenic heat production vary by a factor of more than 20. Recent experimental results demonstrate the potential for direct assessment of mantle radioactivity through observations of geoneutrinos, which are emitted by naturally occurring radionuclides. Predictions of the geoneutrino signal from the mantle exist for several established estimates of mantle composition. Here we present novel analyses, illustrating surface variations of the mantle geoneutrino signal for models of the deep mantle structure, including those based on seismic tomography. These variations have measurable differences for some models, allowing new and meaningful constraints on the dynamics of the planet. An ocean based geoneutrino detector deployed at several strategic locations will be able to discriminate between competing compositional models of the bulk silicate Earth. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},
